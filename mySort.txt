The sorting algorithm I chose to implement is the Cocktail (Shaker) sort. The cocktail sort has the time complexity of O(n^2) in it's best and worst case scenario and it's space complexity is O(1). The Cocktail sort is like the bubble sort but is as bit more efficient. It has two iterations: moving forward in the array and then swapping values and then backwards in the array swapping values. The values swap in the first iteration if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right (considering ascending order). The values swap in the second iteration if the value on the right is smaller than the value on the left (considering ascending order). This continues back and forth until the array is sorted.
